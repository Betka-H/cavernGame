    Dear passengers, we are about to arrive to [space base name].'
  - 'Please have your communicator devices ready, as you will receive more instructions
    shortly after landing.

    [bzzt]'



  - '[you hear a beep from your communicator device]'
  - '[you have incoming messages]'
  - Heey! Welcome to [space base]!
  - Since you're one of the new guys, it is my duty to show you around a bit and
    get you familiar with the place.
  - We can start right away!
  - You will find me by the cave elevator, it's just down the hall from the main
    entrance.
  - Can't miss it.



  - Oh, and if you're having trouble moving around, that's because the gravity here
    is a bit messed up.
  - But don't worry, you'll get used to it.
  - Just use the [A] key to go left, [D] to go right and jump with [spacebar].
  - No jumping allowed up here in the lab though.
  - Sorry.
  - I don't make the rules.
  - '[...]'
  - Anyway, hurry over so we can get started properly!



  - Welcome once again!
  - I forgot to introduce myself. My name's [name], but everyone calls me MG.
  - Short for Mission Guy. Yup.
  - Anyway, like I said, it's my duty to show you around today.
  - The rooms you just walked past are the research labs. That's where you will hand
    over the stuff you find in the cave.
  - That will allow the lab boys to do science research and you will be able to use
    the materials to craft gear to use in your next expeditions.
  - Don't worry, they'll walk you through the whole process when the time comes.
    For now, just note that we have labs here. Yup.
  - But now, we've got some cave exploration to do!
  - Head over to that elevator and call me once you're downstairs.
  - '[...]'
  - Huh? Why don't I accompany you downstairs?
  - Simply put, I'm just the mission guy here. I'm not authorised to go down there.
  - But you are! Lucky you. Now, get going! We haven't got time to spare.



  - Alright! Welcome to the cavern.
  - Your first mission is to find 3 green gems.
  - The lab boys say that's all they need before they're able to make some new special
    equipment they designed. That's science for 'ya.
  - Anyway, just walk around a bit and you should be able to find some of the stuff.



  - By the way, don't worry if you don't find anything the first time around.
  - Just keep coming back and eventually something'll pop up.
  - '[...]'
  - Hm? 'Won't that be sort of pointless?'
  - '[...]'
  - Oh!!
  - I KNEW i forgot to mention something important!
  - Right. So, this cave. Not your usual cave complex, as you might be used to from
    Earth, no.
  - The interesting thing about this cave is that every few hours or so, there is
    an earthquake, and the entire Cavern starts shifting!
  - Every time that happens, it's an entirely new place down there. We've barely
    managed to secure a safe access point.
  - So, don't worry if you won't be able to find all of the mission items in one
    trip. You can just come back a bit later and find the rest.
  - '[...]'
  - Ok, that really should be everything! Good luck! I'll be waiting upstairs.
