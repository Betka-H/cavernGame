    Dear passengers, we are about to arrive to [space base name].'
  - 'Please have your communicator devices ready, as you will receive more instructions
    shortly after landing.

    [bzzt]'



  - '[you hear a beep from your communicator device]'
  - '[you have incoming messages]'
  - Heey! Welcome to [space base]!
  - Since you're one of the new guys, it is my duty to show you around a bit and
    get you familiar with the place.
  - We can start right away!
  - You will find me by the cave elevator. It's just down the hall from the main entrance.
  - Can't miss it.



  - Oh, and if you're having trouble moving around, that's because the gravity here
    is a bit messed up.
  - But don't worry, you'll get used to it.
  - Just use the [A] key to go left, [D] to go right and jump with [spacebar].
  - No jumping allowed up here in the lab though.
  - Sorry.
  - I don't make the rules.
  - '[...]'
  - Whatever, hurry over so we can get started properly!



  - Welcome once again!
  - I forgot to introduce myself. My name's [name], but everyone calls me MG.
  - Short for Mission Guy. Yup.
  - Anyway, like I said, it's my duty to show you around today.
  - The rooms you just walked past are the research labs. That's where you will hand
    over the stuff you find in the cave.
  - That will allow the lab boys to do science research and you will be able to use
    the materials to craft gear to use in your next expeditions.
  - Don't worry, they'll walk you through the whole process when the time comes.
    For now, just note that we have labs here. Yup.
  - But now, we've got some cave exploration to do!
  - Head over to that elevator and call me once you're downstairs.
  - '[...]'
  - Huh? Why don't I accompany you downstairs?
  - Simply put, I'm only the mission guy here. I'm not authorised to go down there.
  - But you are! Lucky you. Now, get going! We haven't got time to spare.



  - Alright! Welcome to the cavern.
  - Your first mission is to find 3 green gems. Lab boys need 'em for some new gadget they're working on.
  - You can press [Q] to see your inventory and mission progress.
  - Anyway, just walk around a bit and you should be able to find some of the stuff.



  - By the way, don't worry if you don't find anything the first time around.
  - Just keep coming back and eventually something'll pop up.
  - '[...]'
  - Hm? 'Won't that be sort of pointless?'
  - '[...]'
  - Oh!!
  - I KNEW i forgot to mention something important!
  - Right. So, this cave. Not your usual cave complex, as you might be used to from
    Earth, no.
  - The interesting thing about this cave is that every few hours or so, there is
    an earthquake, and the entire Cavern starts shifting!
  - Every time that happens, it's an entirely new place down there. We've barely
    managed to secure a safe access point.
  - So, don't worry if you won't be able to find all of the mission items in one
    trip. You can just come back a bit later and find the rest.
  - '[...]'
  - Ok, that really should be everything! Good luck! I'll be waiting upstairs.



  - Got everything? Great!
  - Bring it over to the crafting lab and the science assistant will instruct you further.



  - Hey! Nice to have you here.
  - And the rocks you brought from the underground.
  - Nice to have them too.
  - [...]
  - Ahem, let's get started.
  - This machine is able to reconstruct a piece of gear from just a part of it and a handful of extra material.
  - We already have an item scrap in the lab stash, so insert that by clicking on it.



  - The machine automatically calculates the cost of the reconstruction.
  - Thanks to your last expedition, we now have enough materials to craft this item.
  - Just push the big button and the machine will do it's thing.



  - Neat! That's all from me for now.
  - You can equip the shoes at the locker room nextdoors.


(if gone to MG first)
  - Cool, what did you get?
  - [...]
  - Oh! Shoes. Pretty good.
  - Go equip them at the locker room and come back for your first real mission!


(at eq lab. skip prev call if first)
  - Hey, new guy!
  - What've you got?
  - [...]
  - Shoes? Alright!
  - Go ahead, try them on!



  - Fancy.
  - The guys nextdoors are like magicians with that crafting machine of theirs, I'm telling 'ya.
  - Anyway, no time to waste!
  - Go talk to MG about your next assignment.



  - Hey! These shoes look good on you!
  - They compliment the uhh...
  - The orange.
  - [...]
  - Man, I wish they'd give ME some new shoes every once in a while.
  - I've had these ones since i came here!
  - And that's been...
  - A while.
  - [...]
  - Anyway!
  - You've successfully completed the first misson.
  - Nice job! It only gets worse from here.
  - [...]
  - Just kidding... I'ts about average.
  - Here you go! Good luck.

    Dear passengers, we are about to arrive to Geology research station B-512.'

    shortly after landing.

    [bzzt]'



  - '[you hear a beep from your communicator device]'
  - '[you have incoming messages]'
  - Heey! Welcome to Geology B-512!
  - I'm here to give you instructions.
  - Find me by the cave elevator and we'll talk more!



  - Oh, and if you're having trouble moving around, that's because the gravity here
    is messed up.
  - You'll be fine in no time. Just use the [A] key to go left, [D] to go right and jump with [spacebar].
  - No jumping allowed up here in the lab though.
  - Sorry. I don't make the rules.



  - Welcome once again!
  - I forgot to introduce myself. My name's Michael, but everyone here calls me MG. Short for Mission Guy.
  - My role is to introduce you to this place and then assign you missions.
  - The rooms you just walked past are the labs. There, you will craft and equip gear to help you with your expeditions.
  - Don't worry, they'll walk you through the whole process when the time comes.
  - But now, you've got some cave exploration to do!

  - But you are! Lucky you. Now, get going! We haven't got time to spare.



  - Alright! Welcome to the cavern.
  - Your first mission is to find some rocks. You will need them for a new piece of equipment.
  - When you find the required items, go back to the lab and the lab boys will collect what you got.
  - You can press [Q] to see your inventory and mission progress.



  - By the way, don't worry if you don't find all of the items in one go.
  - You will hand over what you've got and return back to the cave until you gather all of them.
  - '[...]'
  - Oh!! I KNEW I forgot to mention something important!
  - This cave is special.
  - Every few hours or so, there is an earthquake, and the entire cave starts moving around.
  - Each time that happens, it's an entirely new place. We've barely managed to secure a safe access point.
  - So, if you can't find some items for your mission, come back a bit later and try again.
  - Ok, that really should be everything. Good luck! I'll be waiting upstairs.



  - Got everything? Great!
  - Bring it over to the crafting lab and the assistant there will instruct you further.

  - This machine is able to reconstruct a piece of gear from just a part of it and a handful of extra material.
  - Thanks to your last expedition, we now have enough materials in the lab stash to craft an item.
  - Usually, you would not be able to use scraps and rocks from the lab stash to craft your equipment, but because it's your first time, we'll make an exception.
  - You can insert the scrap by selecting it from your inventory on the left side.



  - The machine automatically calculates the cost of the reconstruction.
  - Just push the big button and watch the magic happen.



  - Neat! That's all from me for now.
  - You can equip the shoes at the locker room nextdoors.

//* trader chance 0 in tutorial?

  - Oh! Seems you've ran into the Trader.
  - It's a critter that collects junk in the caves and offers it in exchange for other cave junk.
  - It even sells gear scraps sometimes! That's the only way you can get them.
  - Just watch your pockets. That thing can disappear in the blink of an eye, along with half your belongings.
