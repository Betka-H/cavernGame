  messages:
  - Hey! Nice to have you here.
  - And the rocks you brought from the underground.
  - Nice to have them too.
  - '[...]'
  - Ahem, let's get started.
  - This machine is able to reconstruct a piece of gear from just a part of it and
    a handful of extra material.
  - Thanks to your last expedition, we now have enough materials in the lab stash
    to craft an item.
  - Usually, you would not be able to use scraps and rocks from the lab stash to
    craft your equipment, but because it's your first time, we'll make an exception.
  - You can insert the scrap by selecting it from your inventory on the left side.
