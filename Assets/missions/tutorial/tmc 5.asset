  - By the way, don't worry if you don't find all of the items in one go.
  - You will hand over what you've got and return back to the cave until you gather
    all of them.
  - '[...]'
  - Oh!! I KNEW I forgot to mention something important!
  - This cave is special.
  - Every few hours or so, there is an earthquake, and the entire cave starts moving
    around.
  - Each time that happens, it's an entirely new place. We've barely managed to secure
    a safe access point.
  - So, if you can't find some items for your mission, come back a bit later and
    try again.
  - Ok, that really should be everything. Good luck! I'll be waiting upstairs.
