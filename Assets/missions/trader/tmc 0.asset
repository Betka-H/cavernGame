  - Oh! Seems you've ran into the Trader.
  - It's a critter that collects junk in the caves and offers it in exchange for other cave junk.
  - It even sells gear scraps sometimes! That's the only way you can get them.
  - Just watch your pockets. That thing can disappear in the blink of an eye, along with half your belongings.
